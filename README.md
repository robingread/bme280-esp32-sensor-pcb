# BEM280/ESP32 Home IoT Temperature Sensor PCB Design

This is a [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org) project! It is the PCB design for IoT sensor
based on a [Pimoroni BME280](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/bme280-breakout?variant=29420960677971) and a [AZ-Delivery ESP32 Development Board C](https://www.az-delivery.uk/products/esp32-developmentboard).

It represents the PCB for the accompanying [MQTT Based BME280 & ESP32 IOT Sensor software](https://github.com/robingread/esp32-bme280-mqtt-iot-sensor), which is another one of my GitHub projects.

The latest Schematic and PCB design are shown below:
